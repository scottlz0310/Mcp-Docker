# Requirements Document

## Introduction

GitHub Actionsシミュレーターが`scripts/run-actions.sh`から起動された際に、ワークフローが選択された後にハングアップし、最大600秒でタイムアウトして失敗する問題を根本的に調査・修正する。この問題により、ユーザーはワークフローのシミュレーションを実行できない状態になっている。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify the root cause of the GitHub Actions simulator hangup issue, so that I can understand where the execution flow gets stuck.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the execution flow is traced from `scripts/run-actions.sh` to the final act execution THEN the system SHALL identify the exact point where the hangup occurs
2. WHEN analyzing the Docker container execution THEN the system SHALL determine if the issue is related to container configuration, networking, or process management
3. WHEN examining the act wrapper implementation THEN the system SHALL verify if timeout handling, process monitoring, or subprocess execution is causing the hangup
4. WHEN investigating the simulation service THEN the system SHALL check if output capture, logging, or service initialization is blocking the execution

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze the timeout and process management mechanisms, so that I can determine if they are functioning correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the timeout configuration is examined THEN the system SHALL verify that the 600-second timeout is properly applied and monitored
2. WHEN the process monitoring logic is analyzed THEN the system SHALL ensure that heartbeat messages and process polling are working correctly
3. WHEN the subprocess execution is reviewed THEN the system SHALL confirm that stdout/stderr streaming and thread management are not causing deadlocks
4. WHEN the Docker socket communication is tested THEN the system SHALL verify that the act binary can properly communicate with the Docker daemon

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement comprehensive debugging and logging capabilities, so that I can trace the execution flow and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debug logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL output detailed information about each step of the execution process
2. WHEN the execution reaches a potential hang point THEN the system SHALL log the current state, process status, and resource usage
3. WHEN timeout scenarios occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear diagnostic information about what was happening when the timeout was triggered
4. WHEN Docker operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log Docker daemon communication and container lifecycle events

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix the identified hangup issues, so that the GitHub Actions simulator can execute workflows successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the root cause is identified THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate fixes to resolve the hangup issue
2. WHEN process management is improved THEN the system SHALL ensure proper cleanup of resources and subprocess termination
3. WHEN timeout handling is enhanced THEN the system SHALL provide more granular timeout controls and better error reporting
4. WHEN Docker integration is optimized THEN the system SHALL ensure reliable communication with the Docker daemon and proper container management

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate the fix through comprehensive testing, so that I can ensure the simulator works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the fixed simulator is tested THEN the system SHALL successfully execute various workflow files without hanging
2. WHEN timeout scenarios are tested THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with proper error messages
3. WHEN multiple consecutive executions are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain stability and performance
4. WHEN different workflow configurations are tested THEN the system SHALL handle various job types, environments, and execution parameters correctly
